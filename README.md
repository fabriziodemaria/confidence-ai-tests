# Confidence OpenFeature Demo

This repo contains a tiny Python script showing how to wire the Spotify Confidence SDK into an OpenFeature client. Install the deps with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, set your real client secret and flag keys in `main.py`, then run `python main.py` to fetch the configured string flags.
